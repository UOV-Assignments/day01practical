Practice Tasks in Java

## 1) Display a Text Message

Create a program that outputs a message to the terminal.

```

## 2) Output Numbers from 1 to 10

Use a loop to display numbers from 1 through 10 sequentially.
```bash
  Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

## 3) Display Numbers in Descending Order

Write a program that prints numbers from 10 down to 1.
```bash
  Example: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
    
## 4) Print Odd Numbers Between 1 and 20

Utilize a loop to print all odd numbers between 1 and 20.

```bash
  Example: 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19
```

## 5) Mirror Image Number Pattern

Write a program that accepts a number as input and outputs a mirrored number pattern where the left part is reversed and the right part remains in ascending order.

```bash
  Example: 
  Input: 8 → Output: 4 3 2 1 5 8 7 6
  Input: 14 → Output: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 8 14 13 12 11 10 9

## 6) Build a Learner Class

Create a class named `Learner` with attributes such as `fullName` and `scores`. Instantiate five learner objects and store them in a data collection. Compute and present each learner's average score.

```bash
  Example: 

  Name: Kavindu
  Average of Kavindu is: 72.33333333333333
  ----------------------------------------
  Name: Senuri
  Average of Senuri is: 65.0
  ----------------------------------------
  Name: Mevan
  Average of Mevan is: 59.5
  ----------------------------------------
  Name: Tharushi
  Average of Tharushi is: 97.0
  ----------------------------------------

  Average of Akash is: 78.66666666666667
  ----------------------------------------
```

## 7) Library Inventory System

Design a class structure for a library that manages various book types like Hardcovers, Digital Books, and Audio Editions. Use inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to represent the collection and book-specific characteristics.

```bash
